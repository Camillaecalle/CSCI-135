//The Corn Maze Problem-Streams
//Task 1 Reading in Directions 

/*Create a file called direction_reader.cpp that reads a sequence of letters from cin and prints out its corresponding direction.

‘R’: go Right of the current location
‘L’: go Left of the current location
‘U’: go Up from the current location
‘D’: go Down from the current location 

Example

If you have a file movement.txt that contains:

R R G Q D L T L U R
Then if you redirect it into the program, it should report:

$ ./maze_setup < movement.txt
Right
Right
Down
Left
Left
Up
Right */

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string s;
    while(cin >> s) { 
        if (s=="R")
            cout << "Right" << endl;
        else if (s=="L")
            cout<<"Left"<<endl; 
        else if (s== "U")
            cout<<"Up"<<endl;
        else if (s == "D")
            cout<<"Down"<<endl;
        else
            cout<< "Invalid direction" << endl;
        cout << s << endl;  // print the read word
    }

}
